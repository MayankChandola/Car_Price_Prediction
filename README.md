Car Prices Prediction
Machine Learning and deep learning have gained rapid traction in the recent decade. It would be really helpful if we are able to predict the prices of car based on a few set of features such as horsepower, make and other features. Imagine if a company wants to set the price of a car based on some of the features that it came forth with such as make, horsepower and mileage. It could do so with the help of machine learning models that would help it to determine the price of car. This would ensure that the company sets the right amount so that they get the most profits while setting such a price. Therefore, the machine learing models that we would be working with would ensure that right price is set to new cars which would save a lot of money for car manufacturers respectively.

We would be working with the car prices prediction data and looking for the predictions of different kinds of cars. We would be first visualizing the data and understanding some of the information that is very important for predictions. We would be using different regression techniques to get the average price of the car under consideration.

We would be working with quite a large data which contain about 10000 data points where again we would be dividing that into training set and the test set respectively.
